Sunday Roundup,"This week saw the first conservative government reelected to a second term in the U.K. since Margaret Thatcher's. Returns showed David Cameron winning easily, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats losing big. But the other clear losers were the pollsters, along with anyone who believed their predictions of a virtual tie. Pollsters are not exactly on a roll. In March, polls wrongly showed a dead-heat in Israel between the Zionist Union party and Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud, which, in fact, won handily. And here at home, polls in the 2014 midterms overestimated Democrats in Senate races by four percent. As three new candidates -- Mike Huckabee, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson -- tossed their hats into the crowded presidential ring this week, it's a good time to remind ourselves about the folly of breathless poll-obsessed political coverage. It's the people, not the polls, that matter. And focusing on the horse race at the expense of debating real issues makes losers of us all.",2

Sunday Roundup,"This week Donald Trump crossed the delegate threshold he needs to secure the Republican nomination. And the nation crossed the danger threshold of electing the most unstable, unready and extreme president in U.S. history. But not to worry, says Paul Manafort. In an interview with HuffPost's Howard Fineman, the Trump campaign manager assures us Trump will show America he can ""fill the chair."" And that ban on Muslims? ""He's already started moderating on that,"" Manafort said. ""He operates by starting the conversation at the outer edges and then brings it back towards the middle. Within his comfort zone, he'll soften it some more."" The problem is that softened racism, xenophobia and misogyny are no less dangerous. Though the media, which has already retreated to horserace coverage, won't call Trump out, others will. Sheila Foster Anthony, sister of the late Vince Foster, spoke up about Trump's airing of conspiracy theories about her brother's death. ""It is beyond contempt,"" she wrote, ""that a politician would use a family tragedy to further his candidacy."" But that's where Trump lives. And it should never be a part of America's comfort zone.",2

That is why people who actually want to see inequality reduced, and for poor and middle class to share in the benefits from growth, are not likely to be very happy about President Obama's speech on the topic. His comment about the government being a bystander ignores the real source of the problem. Therefore it is not likely that he will come up with much by way of real solutions.",0
